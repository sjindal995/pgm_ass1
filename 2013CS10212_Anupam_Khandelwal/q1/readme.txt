1. File formats
——————————————————————————————————————————
Network File
——————————————————————————————————————————
First line of this file contains an integer n, specifying number of nodes in the network. Node labels are 1,2,3,…,n
Next n lines contain adjacency list for all the nodes where ith line contains adjacency list for node labelled i (i ranges from 1 to n).
An adjacency list for node i is written as 
<i><space><[comma separated list of children of i]>
For example : 
5 [7,8,12]
is an adjacency list of node labelled 5 having children nodes as 7,8,12.
7 []
is an adjacency list of node labelled 7 having no children.
See sample-bn.txt for a sample Bayesian network. This network is for student-network described in class, where nodes D,I,G,S,L are
labelled as 1,2,3,4,5 respectively.

——————————————————————————————————————————
Query File (For Q1b)
——————————————————————————————————————————
First line of this file contains an integer q, specifying number of queries. Next q lines specify queries.
Each query format is as follows : 
<Xi node><space><Xj node><space><[comma separated list of observed nodes]>
For example :
1 4 [3,5]
Here Xi = 1, Xj = 4, and evidence nodes = {3,5}, so you have to find if nodes 1 and 4 are d-separated given the evidence {3,5}.
See sample-query.txt for some sample queries on student network.

——————————————————————————————————————————
Output File (For Q1b)
——————————————————————————————————————————
For each query in query file, you have to print two lines in output.txt.
First line is the query, which is exactly same as in query file.
Second line is the output. If the nodes are d-separated, output yes, otherwise output no<space>[comma-separated list of nodes]. Here comma-separated list of nodes
specify the active trail.
See sample-output.txt for output corresponding to sample-query.txt

2. Instructions for running display.py
--------------------------------------------------
Installing Graphviz
--------------------------------------------------
1. Download Graphviz from http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/stable/SOURCES/graphviz-2.38.0.tar.gz
2. Extract graphviz-2.38.0.tar.gz. You will get a folder graphviz-2.38.0.
3. cd graphviz-2.38.0
4. ./configure
5. make
6. sudo make install

-------------------------------------------------
Running display.py
-------------------------------------------------
python display.py <network file> <output file>
Example : python display.py sample-bn.txt sample-output.txt

It will generate eps files for each query named as 1.eps, 2.eps,...

Figure notations : 
Red colored nodes : query nodes
Green colored nodes : observed nodes
Blue colored edges : Active trail

Note : output file is optional. If run without output file, it will generate a single file "bn.eps" showing the bayesian network.

3. Instructions for running formatchecker.py

This script checks if your output file for Q.1 (b) is in correct format or not. Please run this script before submitting your code and verify that the output file 
generated is in correct format. Command for running this script is : 
python formatchecker.py <output file>
Example : python formatchecker.py sample-output.txt

4. What to submit : 

Your submitted zip file should contain 2 directories "q1" and "q2" for Q1 and Q2.
Folder q1 should contain 3 sub directories : q1a, q1b, and q1c.

Folder q1a should contain a run.sh script, which takes two arguments : number of nodes (n) in the bayesian network, and max number of children (k) for each node.
After running, It should create a file bn.txt, which contains the bayesian network generated specified in the format above.
Example : ./run.sh 100 5 should create a bayesian network in bn.txt with 100 nodes, each node having max 5 children.

Folder q1b should contain a run.sh script, which takes two arguments : bayesian network file and query file.
After running, it should create a file out.txt, containing the output of queries in the format specified above.
Example : ./run.sh sample-bn.txt sample-query.txt should create a file out.txt (similar to sample-output.txt)

Folder q1c should contain the image files generated by running display.py on sample-bn.txt and sample-output.txt.

Folder q2 contains code for Q2. Since this question will not be evaluated by automatic checker, you are free to have any files in this folder.
